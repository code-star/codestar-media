# Codestar Media Guidelines

## Spelling of Codestar

It's **Codestar**, not:

- ~~CODESTAR~~
- ~~CODE.STAR~~
- ~~Code.Star~~
- ~~Code Star~~

## Logo

4 versions of the logo exist, each to be used in different contexts:

- _Standard_: this is the original logo from the artist. The `STAR` part and the tagline are slightly transparent, making it look nice on backgrounds that are uniform and not too light. Typically, this would mostly only look nice on the website, and not for presentations or prints. Also, do not use on merch.
- _Light_: the `STAR` and tagline are black, making it ideal for use in light themes.
- _Dark_: the `STAR` and tagline are white, making it ideal for use in dark themes.
- _Monochrome_: pure black version for use in printed media.

Examples of bad usages:

> From a presentation slide, black logo on a dark theme
> <img src=examples/black_on_dark.png width=536/>

> From out video propaganda trailer, standard (transparent) on pure black
> <img src=examples/standard_on_black.png width=756/>

> From a presentation slide, standard (transparent) logo on non-unified background
> <img src=examples/standard_on_non_unified_background.png width=404>
